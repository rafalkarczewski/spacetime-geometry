### TL;DR

We redefine the latent space of diffusion models as a spacetime continuum $(\mathbf{x}_t,t)$. Using ideas from information geometry, we impose a geometric structure that captures how the denoising distribution changes as we move through latent spacetime. Surprisingly, we can compute shortest paths efficientlyâ€”even in high dimensions.

Each directory contains instructions on how to set up the necessary environment, and how to run code to reproduce results from the paper.

#### Toy experiments

This directory contains experiments on the toy experiments with 1D Gaussian mixture. These include code necessary to recreate Fig1 and Fig5 (left).

#### Image experiments

This directory contains experiments on image data using the EDM2 model. These are discussed in Section 3.4.

#### Molecular experiments

This directory contains experiments on transition path sampling for molecular data, as discussed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 in the paper.
